jQuery-switchButton
===================

jQuery iPhone-like switch button  meant to be used on a ```<input type="checkbox">```.

This widget will replace the receiver element with an iPhone-style switch button with two states: "on" and "off". Labels
of the states are customizable, as are their presence and position. The receiver element's "checked" attribute is updated
according to the state of the switch, so that it can be used in a ```<form>```.

Dependencies
------------

This is a jQuery UI plugin, so you'll need jQuery and jQuery UI.


Usage
-----

Say this is your markup:

    <form action="...">
      <label for="great">Isn't it great?!</label><input type="checkbox" name="great" id="great">
    </form>

You can transform this checkbox to a nice-looking switch button by calling ```switchButton()``` on it:

    options = { /* see below */ };
    $("input#great").switchButton(options);

By default, this will display a button with "ON" and "OFF" labels on each side of the switch. You can control this and other
parameters at initialization or by calling ```switchButton("option", "optionName", value)```.
Here are the available options:

    checked: undefined        // State of the switch

    show_labels: true         // Should we show the on and off labels?
    labels_placement: "both"  // Position of the labels: "both", "left" or "right"
    on_label: "ON"            // Text to be displayed when checked
    off_label: "OFF"          // Text to be displayed when unchecked

    width: 25                 // Width of the button in pixels
    height: 11                // Height of the button in pixels
    button_width: 12          // Width of the sliding part in pixels

    clear: true               // Should we insert a div with style="clear: both;" after the switch button?
    clear_after: null         // Override the element after which the clearing div should be inserted (null > right after the button)
    on_callback: undefined,     //callback function that will be executed after going to on state
    off_callback: undefined,        //callback function that will be executed after going to off state
    trigger_callback_onload: true  // If the callbacks to be triggered on pageload or not.

Styling
-------

The button and labels are styled with a few lines of CSS in ```jquery.switchButton.css```.
